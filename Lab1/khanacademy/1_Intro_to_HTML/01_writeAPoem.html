        <h1>Eternal Embrace</h1>
    
        <p>
            In love's soft dance, two hearts entwine, <br>
            A melody sweet, a love divine.<br>
            Through whispered words and gentle touch,<br>
            A symphony of emotions, oh, how they clutch.<br>
    
            In moonlit nights, where stars align,<br>
            Love's glow, a beacon, forever to shine.<br>
            Through joy and sorrow, a journey unfolds,<br>
            A story of passion, in love's script it's told.<br>
    
            Hand in hand, through the trials we face,<br>
            Love's embrace, a haven, a sacred space.<br>
            In laughter and tears, through thick and thin,<br>
            Love's resilient flame, a fire within.
        </p>
